# Daily ArXiv

A curated collection of arXiv papers with open-source implementations, specifically focusing on Signal Processing (eess.SP) and Information Theory (cs.IT) categories. This repository is designed to serve researchers and practitioners in information and communication systems by providing easy access to papers that come with their source code implementations.

## Overview
This project automatically tracks and analyzes papers from eess.SP (Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing) and cs.IT (Computer Science - Information Theory) categories on arXiv daily using GitHub Actions. It specifically identifies and catalogs papers that have released their source code, making it easier for researchers in information and communication systems to find implementable research work.

The main features include:
- Daily updates of papers with open-source implementations
- Focus on signal processing and information theory research
- Automatic tracking and organization
